            "DC can STILL give us a compelling movie  Wasn t quite hyped about it  I mean  an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies  what could I even expect  Then  the reviews started to drop  Still wasn t sure if I would like it  And after I saw it  it was way better than I thought it would be  I won t call it a masterpiece  but it definitely is on my top  DC films of all times   Good   There s hardly anything bad about Joker  Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life  Rather than a typical superhero supervillain origin story  we get to see a psychological drama   horror  and thank God  we got that  I love the genre  I love films like Infinity War  Days of Future Past  Endgame and Raimi s Spider Man  But occasionally  it s really good to take a break from such films  It s  kind of  in the category of films like Unbreakable  Basically  the movie is  no spoilers ahead  Arthur  being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner  loses his mind after the constant torment and after that  all hell breaks loose  That s all the movie shows  It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this  since there are many movies with this kind of plot  awfully crappy ones included   I completely liked this movie  means the screenplay and direction worked for me  You can feel for Arthur  whenever the movie asks you to  You want to root for Arthur  but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen  We see him slowly transition into Joker  and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause  We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens  Without getting into spoilers  I would say   in short   that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense  Whatever Joker  a psychopath  says is more realistic than what a sane person says  And obviously has some sick  terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have  If it s not clear by the trailers  there s no Batman here  But  again  no spoilers  it does have some Batman references to support the movie  It could ve created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline  but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker   Mixed   It is a good thing that the movie has a s psycho horror vibe to it  But  it could ve been more original  Like many others have pointed out  it s similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese  While it wasn t a copy and paste of Taxi Driver  but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver  Not necessarily a bad thing  the movie has the elements as a homage ish way  but looking at how well made it was  it could ve been slightly more original  And  it may feel a bit slow for some people  though it s worth your time   My take on the controversy   It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence  It can happen with any violent movie  But  even though it justified the Joker s actions  it doesn t show them to be right  Speaking of violence  it s just psychologically compelling horror  It s less violent than Deadpool  but feels more violent as it s a serious movie  So  glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense   Conclusion   It s a must watch  You don t need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it  But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle  Wrong expectations might ruin the experience  Else  I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises  And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre  If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list  you may consider it to be great  One last thing  people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good  The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold   Rating   Score      Grade   A\n",

            "Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from  It s interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this  and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off  It s just a whole lot of self seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow  It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all  not about the character nor about the society he s part of   It is also  Joker  only in name and has very little to do with the super villain  I m all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit  Even  Proto Joker  doesn t quite do it justice  and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e g  Arthur  The Untalented Mr  Fleck  Smoker  Poser etc  Infact he s more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme  and is not even close to embodying the joker s extreme form of nihilism  It s not that it has to be a comic book accurate portrayal  that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie  But far from being a masterpiece   it doesn t quite manage even that  It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker s spirit or essence  but also as a film about a person going over the edge   The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction  The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur  A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump like and one dimensional Thomas Wayne character  This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song  In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that  It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way  and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other   The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix s performance  which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two  I wouldn t put it in the same league as Heath Ledger s portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters  Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in  To put it simply  Ledger made it seem natural and didn t look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is  even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times  Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be  that s not necessarily a criticism   Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more  I don t see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it s  inspired  by  or CBM s like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton s Batman  are remembered today\n",
